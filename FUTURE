Anyone with a mind toward improvements is welcome to attempt implementation of
the following, or other, desired future features.  As always, keep the original
authors in the loop.

-- smarter handling of IO, file permissions, and general web security

-- Someone with better understanding of PHP security can probably tell me which
   is better, to have the username/password in plaintext and the salt hidden
   or vice versa.  I just don't see how to combine it all in a totally secure
   way at the moment

-- A locally generated article information database, so that articles' data
   don't have to be re-loaded from the web each time the script is run.  Doing
   this would allow a much shorter delay between processing each submission, 
   and much quicker updating.

-- Options for sorting by, e.g., web submission date, paper submission
   date, type, etc.
